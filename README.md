### WHAT CAN I DO WITH PLAYERTIMELIMIT?

This simple plugin allows you to create a system in which players can play a limited amount of time in your server (or certain worlds), for example just 2 hours a day. This idea of the plugin came originally from Youtube Minecraft series but it can be used for other cases as well.

Players with no time left will be kicked from the server, and they will not be able to join again until the playtimes are reset. You can even set time limits for each rank on your server!
